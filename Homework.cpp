// HOMEWORK QUESTIONS
// 1. A unsorted array is given to you. you need to make it sorted using bubble sort and then search a target element present inside the array which will return the index of the target element. NOTE : To search the element use Binary Search for O(logn) Time complexity.
// 2. A array i.e, {1,1,2,2,2,0,0,2,0} you need to find the first occurence of the 2 and last occurence of the 2 present inside the array then print the index of the first and last occurences of the array.
